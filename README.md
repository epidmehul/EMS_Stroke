# EMS Stroke Triage and Transport Model (ESTTM)
Discrete event simulation model to estimate the impact of EMS stroke triage and transport plans

See model documentation and code for details:

The "base" model does random map and patient generation and computes triage outcomes (ESSTM_documentation.docx, ESSTM_code.ipynb).

The "extended" model includes treatments, inter-hospital transfers, and patient outcomes (ESSTM_documentation_EXTENDED.docx, ESSTM_code_EXTENDED.ipynb).
