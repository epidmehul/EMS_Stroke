<h1>EMS Stroke Triage and Transport Model (ESTTM)</h1>       

 <p>
        The EMS Stroke Triage and Transport Model (ESTTM) is a discrete event simulation to estimate the impact of EMS stroke triage and transport algorithms. We simulate multiple maps and patient cohorts to investigate the effect of EMS routing of suspected LVO patients when the CSC is within a prespecified travel time away from the closest PSC. 
        </p>

        <h2>Maps</h2>
        
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg pt-4 pt-lg-0">
                <img src="map_0.png" class="float-end img-float">
                <p>
                Each map is a square with a randomly generated side length between 30 and 100 miles. The CSC is set to be in the center of the square, with the locations of two PSCs being generated uniformly within the square such that the pairwise distances between the CSC and two PSCs are all greater than 1 mile. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Each map also an additional characteristic, called the <i>equipoise</i>, which denotes the proportion of the square's area that is closest to one of the two PSCs. Only patients which fall into this region are eligible for alternate routing since the other patients would be going to the CSC as the nearest hospital.
                </p>

            <h2>Patients</h2>
            <p>
                40 different cohorts of 1,000 EMS-suspected stroke patients are generated randomly in a square grid, and their locations (x-y coordinates) are scaled by the side length (in miles) of each map. We then simulate the effects of EMS routing to CSCs in 1,000 randomly generated maps using these 40 cohorts of 1,000 patients.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each simulated suspected stroke patient has a "true" stroke diagnosis, which is assigned randomly using set probabilities:
                <ul>
                  <li>Ischemic stroke</li>
	<li>Transient ischemic attack (TIA)</li>
	<li>Hemorrhagic stroke</li>
	<li>Non-stroke ("stroke mimic")</li>
                                 
                   
                </ul>
                Ischemic patients can be either LVO or non-LVO, which is again assigned using a set probability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, each patient has a "last known well" (LKW) time generated randomly through a mixture of uniform distributions.
            </p>

            <h2>Simulation</h2>
                <p>
                    For each map-cohort combination, we first calculate the closest hospital for each patient and a LVO screen result using EMS LVO screening sensitivity and specificity and the true LVO status. The true LVO patients whose LKW time was less than 24 hours had their "correct" destinations set to the CSC. All other patients had their "correct" destination set to the nearest hospital.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The default destination hospital for all patients was set to the nearest hospital, representing the standard EMS practice of transporting suspected stroke patients to the nearest stroke center. We refer to this scenario as the "base case". We then look at patients who were closest to a PSC, diagnosed with LVO, and had a LKW less than 24 hours and allow them to bypass the PSC and directly transported to the CSC if the additional travel time is less than a pre-specified threshold. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After patient cohorts are generated on a map, we then generate random numbers to represent various lengths of time:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Time for EMS to arrive</li>
                        <li>TIme on scene</li>
                    </ul>
                    The time to hospital is calculated based on the destination hospital that was calculated earlier. All these lengths of time are then used to calculate the LKW to door length of time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then calculate the time until treatment for patients and include the possibility of needing to transfer LVO patients from a PSC to the CSC. We use the LKW to door time and pre-specified times from door to treatment (for both IVT and EVT).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Afterwards, we calculate the probability of an mRS of 0-1 using published risk equations and estimated times to IVT or EVT. All of this information is then output for each patient.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In total, we use 3 sets of LVO screening sensitivity/specificity (90%/60%, 75%/75%, and 60%/90%) and 6 possible time thresholds (10-, 20-, 30-, 40-, 50-, and 60-min) for a total of 18 "intervention" scenarios. We also include the base case scenario where no EMS re-routing occurs, leading us to a total of 19 scenarios. 
                </p>
            <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
                <p>
                    The full simulation (40 cohorts of 1,000 patients run on 1,000 different maps and 19 scenarios) will result in 760M data rows. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In postprocessing, we split the data to calculate several outcomes for each map. For each map-cohort-scenario combination, we calculate metrics using the data from the 1,000 patients of that cohort. Afterwards we then average across the 40 cohorts to get the results for each map under all the scenarios. Finally, we take differences between the intervention scenarios and the base case scenario to see how patient triage and outcomes changed.
                    <ul>
                        <li>LVO triage for patients closest to PSCs</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Overtriage: Non-LVO patients routed to the CSC</li>
                                <li>Undertriage: LVO patients sent to PSCs</li>
                            </ul>
                    
                        <li>Time until treatment</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Time to IVT for ischemic patients: (only for ischemic patients whose time to IVT was less than 4.5 hours) </li>
                                <li>Time to EVT for LVO patients: (only for LVO patients whose time to EVT was less than 24 hours)</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>mRS of 0-1</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Ischemic patients</li>
                                <li>LVO patients</li>
                            </ul>

                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    These calculations are then repeated on only patients closest to the PSCs as they are the only ones who could be eligible for re-routing to the CSC.
